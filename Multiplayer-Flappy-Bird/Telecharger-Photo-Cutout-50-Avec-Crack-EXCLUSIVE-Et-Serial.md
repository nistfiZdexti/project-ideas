To create a good YouTube banner, you need to consider some important factors, such as the size, resolution, layout, and design of your image. The recommended size for a YouTube banner is 2560 x 1440 pixels, but you also need to account for the different devices and screen sizes that your viewers may use. You can use YouTube's template to ensure your banner looks good on all devices and avoid cropping or stretching your image.
  
Another factor to consider is the layout of your banner. You want to make sure your banner has a clear focal point and a balanced composition. You also want to avoid placing any important elements, such as text or logos, in the areas that may be covered by your profile picture, channel name, or subscribe button. You can use the safe area in YouTube's template to ensure your banner elements are visible and not obscured.
  
Finally, you want to design your banner in a way that reflects your channel's personality and purpose. You can use colors, fonts, images, and graphics that match your brand or video style and convey your message or value proposition. You can also use your banner to highlight your upload schedule, social media links, or call to action. You can use online tools or software to create your banner or hire a professional designer if you need help.
